# Is this the appropriate way to create optional oneToManys? Making them nullable on the owner end that is.
# A location can presently be attached to BOTH a site and an applicant. I dont like this, I would like a
# location to own EITHER an applicant or a site, never both. An applicant could still live at a site by
# having two Location entries with the same fields.
